[Nov-3-2024.ipynb](Nov-3-2024.ipynb) - reproducing Stuttgart notebook with minor variations

`params` is not visible via `using Flux`; use `Flux.params` or `using Flux: params`

`ADAM` is now `Adam`

I pressed optimization further and reached the state where it stopped converging (which is not a problem for this example).

So the facility which accumulates solutions at intermediate steps becomes useful (see the tail end of the notebook, after cell 77, and, in particular, code in cell 79 (this code is generated by GPT-4o))
