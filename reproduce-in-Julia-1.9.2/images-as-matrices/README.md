[Stuttgart-notebook.ipynb](Stuttgart-notebook.ipynb) - reproduce https://github.com/anhinga/JuliaCon2021-poster/tree/main/Stuttgart-Julia-meetup
with minor modifications

[signed-normalization.ipynb](signed-normalization.ipynb) - reproduce and extend https://github.com/anhinga/JuliaCon2021-poster/tree/main/signed-normalization (the extension includes an exploration whether mixing softmax normalization and signed normalization is promising; the answer to that question is mostly negative)
